This notebook covers exploratory data analysis, data cleaning with methods such as imputation and capping. It also covers feature engineering methods using scaling to ensure large values do not undermine other features. Parameter tuning is performed by using a grid search to find the best perfoming model with the best set of parameters. The best performing model is used to predict life expectancy. Finally, feature importance analysis is carried out to determine which factors influence life expectancy in different countries.
